  <h2> Here's a time line of Marie Curie life:</h2>
 
   <h3> <div>
  <li> <strong>1867</strong>: Born in Warsaw, Congress Poland in Russian Empire.</li>
   <li> <strong>1891</strong>: She moved to Paris, and studied in the Univesity of Paris. </li>
   <li> <strong>1894</strong> She recieve her second degree. </li>
   <li> <strong> 1895</strong>: Written up his research on magnetism and received his own doctorate in March 1895, in July she married Pierre Curie</li>
   <li> <strong> 1897 </strong>: her daughter Irène was born and Marie need to support her family teaching at the École Normale Supérieure. </li>
   <li> <strong> 1898</strong> : In July, Curie and her husband published a joint paper announcing the existence of an element they named "polonium", in honour of her native Poland.</li>
   <li> <strong>1898</strong>: On December, the Curies announced the existence of a second element, which they named "radium", from the Latin word for "ray".</li>
   <li> <strong>1898-1902</strong>: The Curies published, jointly or separately, a total of 32 scientific papers, including one that announced that, when exposed to radium, diseased, tumour-forming cells were destroyed faster than healthy cells.</li>
   <li> <strong> 1903</strong>:In December 1903 the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences awarded Pierre Curie, Marie Curie, and Henri Becquerel the Nobel Prize in Physics</li>
   <li> <strong> 1906</strong> : Her Husband Pierre, died in a road accident. </li>
   <li> <strong> 1910</strong> :Curie succeeded in isolating radium; she also defined an international standard for radioactive emissions that was eventually named for her and Pierre: the curie.</li>
     <li> <strong> 1911</strong>: International recognition for her work had been growing to new heights, and the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, overcoming opposition prompted by the Langevin scandal, honoured her a second time, with the 1911 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.</li>
   <li> <strong> 1915 </strong> :Curie produced hollow needles containing "radium emanation", a colourless, radioactive gas given off by radium, later identified as radon, to be used for sterilizing infected tissue. She provided the radium from her own one-gram supply.</li>
   <li> <strong> 1934 </strong>: Curie died aged 66 at the Sancellemoz sanatorium in Passy, Haute-Savoie, from aplastic anemia believed to have been contracted from her long-term exposure to radiation, causing damage to her bone marrow.</li>

  <h4> <em> "The result of the Curies' work was epoch-making. Radium's radioactivity was so great that it could not be ignored. It seemed to contradict the principle of the conservation of energy and therefore forced a reconsideration of the foundations of physics. On the experimental level the discovery of radium provided men like Ernest Rutherford with sources of radioactivity with which they could probe the structure of the atom. As a result of Rutherford's experiments with alpha radiation, the nuclear atom was first postulated. In medicine, the radioactivity of radium appeared to offer a means by which cancer could be successfully attacked."
